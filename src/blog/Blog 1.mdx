The first thing I did with my partner was confirm the pregnancy the following day at Mt. Alvernia. They did scans at every O&G visit. My baby was confirmed to be a little just over four weeks so there was a baby and a sac without a heartbeat yet.

<br />

I was prescribed prenatal vitamins and a medicine to help keep the baby safe as I had a minor hemorrhage which later on resolved on its own.

Our next O&G visit came after two weeks. My husband and I were able to listen to baby's heartbeat. I had morning sickness as well so I was advised to eat crackers.
Since it was in the midst of pandemic and the world has a lot of travel restrictions, we decided our first baby will be born in Singapore.
