## 1. Get an insurance plan.
I highly recommend you contact your insurance provider and get an insurance plan to cover pregnancy complications. You will not find any coverage for giving birth anyway.
 
<br />

## 2. As you enter motherhood and in a foreign country, you need a support group.
There are Facebook groups for mommies in Singapore. You will find a lot of answers to your questions in there. You may also post in a group when you cannot find a topic.

## 3. Hospital tours are a thing in Singapore.
You need to schedule for an appointment from the website of the hospitals you wish to visit. On the day of your tour, they would give you freebies and sample products.

<br />


## 4. Formula milk and diaper companies in Singapore are generous.
As part of the formula milk and diaper brands campaign, you have the perks to request for free samples. For formula milk, many give 400g tin, can you believe that? Here's another good thing - I did not buy diapers for my baby's first month because of the free samples.

 5. Explore Carousell.
As a foreigner, you will buy your own maternity milk. Carousell is your go to, I tell you. Some companies will give free samples, too.
 The App also has a lot of used but not worn out baby furnitures, clothes and toys.
