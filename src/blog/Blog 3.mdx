## 1. Luggages can be delayed.
It was a long haul flight from Singapore to Stockholm. We had a layover at Helsinki Airport in Finland. One of our luggages arrived later in Stockholm, because there were many luggages to be transported, according to the local luggageA brief background to my life: I've lived 23 years of my life in the Philippines where I was born. Then, I moved to Singapore for work in 2019 and stayed there until 2022. You can only imagine the things I wish I knew before moving to Europe, and to Sweden specifically.
handler of FinnAir. Until now, the luggage hasn't been delivered to our apartment LOL. That's another story.

## 2. You don't tap out your card when taking public transportation.
I think, this one was a muscle memory thingy for me. Little did I know, you just go straight to exit and leave.

## 3. You pay to use the toilet.
There are places where you have to pay first before using the toilet. My advice is before you leave home, empty that bladder first.

<br />

## 4. Sign up for memberships.
My family was always collecting the receipt after paying. Three weeks later (yes that long), we realized discounts did not really apply to our purchases. Then one day, I went to ICA, a grocery store, and asked how to get discounts as advertized on the products. The staff said, I had to get an ICA card.

## 5. Printing and computer shops are not in every corner of the street.
When you go to printing shops, there's an assumption you will be printing a large file of papers and it's not cheap to print a single-page document as well. You may visit the nearest Bibliotek (library) and print. You may print using a computer in the library or your phone. You should be seeing an instruction on how to print.
These are based on my personal experience and opinion. I got more stories to tell so stay tuned!
